Insert poetry here:

In a Station of the Metro by Ezra Pound:

The apparition of these faces in the crowd;

Petals on a wet, black bough.

Second poem:

Birds Punctuate the Days by Joyce Clement:

period

one blue egg all summer long

now gone

3rd poem:

Lines on a Skull by Ravi Shankar:

life's little, our heads

sad. Redeemed and wasting clay

this chance. Be of use.
